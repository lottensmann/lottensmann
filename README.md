## About Me

I'm a doctoral researcher interested in bioinformatics, biostatistics, genomics, lipidomics, and cardiovascular disease. I work with large biobank cohort data to analyze the genetic architecture of the human plasma lipidome and its link to disease risk.

- Currently working on: Lipidomic profiles of smoking and alcohol consumption
- Previously: GWAS of lipid species [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42532-8)  
  Examining links between lipid species and disease risk [EBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(25)00115-X/fulltext)
- Background: MSc Life Science Informatics (University of Helsinki, Finland),
  BSc Bioinformatics and Genome research (University of Bielefeld, Germany)
